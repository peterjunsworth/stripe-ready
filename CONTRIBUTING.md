## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the project repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project until your contributions are ready to be merged.

Fork the repository from [https://github.com/peterjunsworth/stripe-ready](https://github.com/peterjunsworth/stripe-ready).

### 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone your fork to your local machine to begin working on your changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterjunsworth/stripe-ready.git
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch to keep your work isolated from the main branch. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `fix-bug-name` or `add-feature-name`.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 4. Make Your Changes
Make your changes to the codebase. Be sure to:

- Follow the coding style used in the project

### 6. Push Your Changes

- A description of the changes made
- Any related issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Any relevant context or considerations

### 8. Address Feedback
